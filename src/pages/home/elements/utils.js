        Running a business comes with managing a lot of different devices and
        accounts. The easiest way to keep track of their login credentials is to
        use a password manager.
        <br />
        <br />
        With a password manager, your employees can store all their logins in
        one place, share them with coworkers, and access them on multiple
        devices with one password only. No excuse for forgetting passwords after
        a long vacation or for sharing passwords via email!
